*By the end of the guide you should know how to install and manage Metamask, an Ethereum wallet that allows managing ETH and ERC20 tokens securely.*

## Prerequisites
- Chrome or Brave browser

## Install Metamask

[Metamask](https://metamask.io/) offers a mobile wallet and a browser extension. This guide will focus on the latter because it's the most used form of interaction with the application.

The installation process is similar to installing any other browser extension. You can find the latest version on the [official website](https://metamask.io/download.html) or the Chrome Webstore. Click `Add to Chrome` button and confirm as follows:

The last step is to save and verify your backup phrase. This is a mechanism to make sure you can always restore your funds if you lose access to the laptop or mobile device where the wallet is currently used.

Make sure to save this phrase in a secure place offline, and never share it with anybody. After you copied the secret words, you'll need to enter them in the exact sequence as they were presented to you before.

As a result, you can finally access your Ethereum wallet as follows:
