This guide will show you how to make transactions directly from a browser. By the end you will:

* Learn about the Plasma interface
* Interact with Plasma from end to end
* Make a deposit, transfer and exit 

### Setup

The only requirement for this quick start is to have a web3 wallet with funds on Rinkeby. We recommend using the Metamask chrome browser extension.
* If you don't have a web3 wallet installed yet, head over to https://metamask.io/ and follow their instructions.
* This quick start will use a hosted application running [js-starter-kit](https://github.com/omisego/js-starter-kit). If you would like to run the same application locally, you can find the installation instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/omisego/js-starter-kit).

> **Important**  
Only you can keep your tokens safe. Please ensure you understand how to safely store and send tokens before making any transactions, always double check that you are sending to the correct address, and never send your private keys to anyone. Anyone who has your private keys can, and probably will, take your money.
