## Quick Start

This guide will show you how to make transactions directly from a browser. By the end you will:

* learn about the Plasma interface
* Interact with Plasma from end to end
* Make a deposit, transact and exit.

### IMPORTANT

The OMG token contract follows the ERC20 standard, which means OMG is decentralised and the contract owner has no control over it.

Only you can keep your tokens safe. Please ensure you understand how to safely store and send tokens before making any transactions, always double check that you are sending to the correct address, and never send your private keys to anyone. Anyone who has your private keys can, and probably will, take your money.

| If you've sent your tokens to ...                | Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| The OMG smart contract address                   | It's not possible to make transactions from the contract address; your tokens are lost to all                                                                                                                                                       |
| The wrong token address on an exchange           | You can try contacting the exchange with the details of your transaction, but OmiseGO has no power to reverse the transaction or force the exchange to return your tokens.                                                                          |
| A scammer                                        | There's nothing we can do to get your tokens back. We do our best to report scam accounts, so feel free to let us know if you see a suspicious account or website, but we can’t catch them all and can’t take responsibility for their actions.     |
| Some other address that you don’t have access to | No one except the holder of the private keys associated with that address will be able to help you get your tokens back. Unless the person who received them is exceptionally honest and decides to give them back, those tokens are lost for good. |
