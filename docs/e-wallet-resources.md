## Overview
You can use OmiseGO's SDKs, or run the eWallet Server in standalone mode.

## OmiseGO SDK
OmiseGO provides a simple, white label SDK for creating customer-facing wallet apps that utilize the OmiseGO Network without requiring a deep understanding of the underlying technology. 

The SDK allows business users to plug into the network easily and to build wallets that take advantage of Ethereum’s vast potential without compelling any behavioral change on the part of the end customer:

Wallets can be customized to include any functions you need, and to incorporate your own branding.

The wallet allows users to transfer funds in and out of the wallet in any currency, including decentralized currencies, such as ETH and BTC.

The OmiseGO Network is intrinsically agnostic between fiat and decentralized money; the system is constructed to allow the best currencies to win. 

The following SDKs may be used to integrate with the OmiseGO eWallet Server, for example, to integrate a loyalty point system built on on top of the OmiseGO eWallet Server into an existing system:

* [Ruby SDK (Sample Server)](https://github.com/omisego/sample-server)
* [iOS SDK (Sample App)](https://github.com/omisego/sample-ios)
* [Android SDK (Sample App)](https://github.com/omisego/sample-android)


## Running OmiseGO eWallet Server in Standalone Mode
You can also choose to run the OmiseGO eWallet Server in standalone mode, which means there is no need to integrate it into an existing system. 

The following apps demonstrate the capabilities of the OmiseGO eWallet Server as a physical Point-of-Sale server and client:

* [iOS PoS for Merchant](https://github.com/omisego/pos-merchant-ios)
* [iOS PoS for Customer](https://github.com/omisego/pos-client-ios)
* [Android PoS for Merchant](https://github.com/omisego/pos-merchant-android)
* [Android PoS for Customer](https://github.com/omisego/pos-client-android)
