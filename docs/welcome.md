The OMG Network is a decentralized, public network that allows high throughput, low cost peer-to-peer transactions, facilitating financial services across geographies, asset classes, and applications.

The OMG Network leverages Layer 2 Plasma architecture to provide high throughput and strong safety guarantees for third parties who wish to build scalable, decentralized payment apps on the network. 

The OMG Network allows you to access, manage, and transact with digital assets that are kept securely on the blockchain. 

## Try it out

Check out the OMG Network with our [block explorer](https://quest-pre-lumphini.omg.network/) and then send your first transaction in our [quick start guide](quick-start).

If you are already familiar with the OMG Network and developing an application on the network, head over to the [Integration section](integration-introduction).
